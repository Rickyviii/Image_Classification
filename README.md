# Image_Classification _ OPENCLASSROOM MACHINE LEARNING COURSE _ Project 6
Image classification of dog breeds

This repository contains the powerpoint file made for the oral presentation of this project. I'm not allowed to publish the code, for possible 'cheating/copying' problems, as it is the same project for every student following OpenClassrooms ML Course.

Project overview : 

Starting from 120 breeds of dogs (not all existing breeds), Train and construct one or several models, and then a website, which take as an entry a picture of a dog (or a picture of something else...), and as an output, presents the most likely breeds identified among the initial 120 breeds, with the % of likelihood.
